# Recommendation Systems
 
Recommendation systems are useful models that provide suggestions based on filtering based on some attributes put forward by users and/or some historical data (browser history etc). The system takes inputs of information as prior usage and also works off of ratings data that can be supplied - this needs to be assorted into a readable format, so numerical 1-5 stars would work well.
Recommendation systems takes this prior information and filters through to find one or a specified number of top results for this particular instance. This is an extremely useful tool as it can search through very large datasets and produce a top 5 list for a user, saving them valuable time and effort in scanning through individually.
